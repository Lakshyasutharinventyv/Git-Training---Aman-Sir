# Git Workflow Visualization

This repository demonstrates a simple Git workflow involving branching, merging, and tagging. The steps below outline the commands and actions performed to create the state of the repository as shown in the visualization.

## Repository Structure

### Branches
- **master**: The base branch containing the initial commit.
- **prod**: A branch for production code, created from `master`.
- **hotfix**: A branch for hotfixes, created from `prod`.
- **feature1**: A branch for feature development, created from `release1`.
- **release1**: A release branch, created from `prod`.

### Key Actions
1. **Creating the `prod` Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b prod
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit P1 on prod"
   ```

2. **Creating and Merging `hotfix` into `prod`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit P3 on hotfix"
   git checkout prod
   git merge hotfix -m "Merge hotfix into prod"
   ```

3. **Creating `release1` and Merging `feature1`**:
   - Create `release1`:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b release1
     ```
   - Create `feature1` and add commits:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature1
     git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit F1 on feature1"
     git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit F2 on feature1"
     ```
   - Merge `feature1` into `release1`:
     ```bash
     git checkout release1
     git merge feature1 -m "Merge feature1 into release1"
     ```

4. **Tagging `release1`**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a PM -m "Tag PM after merging release1 into prod"
   ```

5. **Merging `release1` into `prod`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout prod
   git merge release1 -m "Merge release1 into prod"
   ```

## Final State
- The `prod` branch includes all changes from `hotfix` and `release1`, with a tagged commit (`PM`).
- The `release1` branch includes merged changes from `feature1`.
- `feature1` and `hotfix` are independent feature branches.

### Visualization
The graph illustrates the relationships between commits, branches, and tags, with `prod` as the current HEAD.
